# Mercadera

Mercadera is the easiest way to sell your things online. 1-click sign in, take a
pic and sell - all completely free.

## Getting Started

The Mercadera project is built using Meteor 1.2 with MongoDB as the backend.
We're using Astronomy to keep records following a proper schema and validate
types. We're using React to keep our front-end UI component based, and easy to
reason about.

We hope you use this project as a good example of how to write a fast, clean
Meteor application without much ceremony.

Pull requests very welcome!
